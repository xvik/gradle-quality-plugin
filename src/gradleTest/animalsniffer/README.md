# Animalsniffer sample

When [animalsniffer](https://github.com/xvik/gradle-animalsniffer-plugin) plugin is enabled,
it is configured the same as other quality plugins.

Also, animalsniffer tasks attached to checkQualityMain (and other source-set scoped check tasks)

Note: exclusions are not applied to animalsniffer plugin (because it makes no sense)

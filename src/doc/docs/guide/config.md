## Manual mode

You can disable [automatic quality plugins registration](automatic.md) (guided by source detection) 
and register required plugins manually:

```groovy
plugins {
    id 'groovy'
    id 'checkstyle'
    id 'pmd'
}

quality {
    autoRegistration = false
}
```

Here checkstyle and pmd plugins will be configured and no other plugins will be registered.

## Disable console output

In some cases it may not be desired to see errors in console. For example, when quality control applied on existing project
and you have thousands of warnings.

```groovy
quality {
    consoleReporting = false
}
```

!!! warning 
    Don't turn off console warnings in other cases: people tend to ignore problems they didn't see 
    (practice shows that normally almost no one looks html reports of quality tools). You must see warnings for
    each build to finally fix them all someday (or fix them as they appear).

Console reporting use xml reports, produced by quality plugins. In case of too many errors, xml parsing could slow down build.
You may use reporting disabling to speed up build a bit. In most cases (when you don't have thousands of errors) console reporting [will be fast](profile.md). 

## Html reports

By default, all plugins are configured to generate both xml and html reports. Xml report is
required for console output and html report preserved for consultation.
If you don't need html reports (e.g. on ci server) they could be disabled:

```groovy
quality {
    htmlReports = false
}
```

## Disable quality plugins

If you want to disable all quality checks:

```groovy
quality {
    enabled = false
}
```

This will disable all quality tasks (by setting `task.enabled = false` for each quality task). Quality tasks will still be visible, but marked as SKIPPED on execution.

!!! note
    `enable` state will not affect tasks called directly. For example, you set `quality.enabled = false` and call `checkstyleMain` - it will be executed.
    Motivation is simple - if you call task directly then you want it to work. 

Also, enabled state not affects quality tasks when quality grouping tasks called. For example, if you call `checkQualityMain` - all quality plugins will be executed,
even if disabled in configuration. Motivation is the same as with direct call - you obviously want to perform quality checks.

!!! note 
    if quality grouping task called as dependency of other task, quality plugins will be skipped. Exceptions applies only to direct cases when expected behaviour is obvious.

## Configuration override

It is still possible to configure quality plugins, but direct configuration closures will not work:

!!! fail
    ```groovy
    checkstyle {  // will not work, because plugin will override it
        ...
    }
    ```

But will work like this:

!!! success
    ```groovy
    afterEvaluate {
        checkstyle { // will be applied after plugin and override configuration
            ...
        }
    }
    ```

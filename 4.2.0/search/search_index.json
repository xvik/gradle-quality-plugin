To use findbugs (as before): disable spotbugs support (quality.spotbugs = false) or enable findbugs plugin manually (in this case spotbugs plugin will not be registered) Update spotbugs exclusions: Exclude NP_METHOD_PARAMETER_TIGHTENS_ANNOTATION check as it prevents @Nullable override, which may be required for guava functions Exclude NP_NULL_ON_SOME_PATH_FROM_RETURN_VALUE check as misleading and not useful 2.4.0 (2017-09-21) \u00b6 Support gradle 4.2 (#3) Update checkstyle 8.0 -> 8.2 Update codenarc 0.27.0 -> 1.0 Update checkstyle config: Move SuppressionCommentFilter inside TreeWalker (8.1 breaking change) Remove FileContentsHolder (8.2 breaking change) New check AnnotationOnSameLine (added in 8.2) added to config, but disabled 2.3.0 (2017-07-24) \u00b6 Update checkstyle 7.6 -> 8.0 Update pmd 5.5.4 -> 5.8.1 Update pmd config: Add description to avoid warning Disable AccessorMethodGeneration check as it makes sense for android projects and not so important for java.

Reference line ranges are not shown anymore (pmd, findbugs and column in checkstyle) - always exact line. (breaking) configure manually registered plugins, even if plugin not supposed to be used due to sources auto detection. Configuration may be disabled using quality configuration flags. Add ability to disable automatic plugins registration: quality.autoRegistration = false. Only manually registered plugins will be configured. Add ability to disable quality tasks with configuration property: quality.enabled = false. Quality tasks will still work if called directly or through grouping task (e.g. checkQualityMain). (breaking) Remove checkstyle html report generation: gradle can generate html report since 2.10 and when gradle generates html report, it puts link to it into main error message Findbugs html report is always generated (not only when errors found like before) Add ability to disable console reporting with configuration property: quality.consoleReporting = false Add grouping tasks for registered quality plugins: checkQualityMain, checkQualityTest (per source set).

Cpd tasks \u00b6 In contrast to other quality tools CPD plugin registers only one task cpdCheck instead of task per source set (otherwise it would be impossible to find duplicates between source sets or even between different modules). By default, cpdCheck task configured to check all available source sets. But quality plugin will modify chpdCheck.source : All files from source sets, not configured for quality checks ( quality.sourceSets ) are removed. This way cpd scope is unified with other quality plugins scope. Global excludes are also applied. Source modifications could be disabled with quality.cpdUnifySources = false If multiple cpd tasks would be registered (other tasks declared manually), sources would be modified only for default cpdCheck task. But console reporting and HTML report will be added for all tasks. Also, all cpd tasks would be disabled with quality.enabled = false Note By default, CPD configured for java sources check. To change target language use: cpd { language = 'groovy' } Warning CPD will try to check all files in enabled source sets. For example, if you have both java and groovy sources in main source set then CPD will try to check both and, most likely, will fail with groovy parse error (as language is java by default). To solve such cases either manually exclude additional sources: cpdCheck . exclude ' * . groovy ' Or split check in multiple tasks, where each task checks only one language (see below), Multiple file types support \u00b6 If you need to check more than one type of files (for example, java and groovy sources), you'll need to configure separate tasks per each required type. For example: cpdCheck . exclude '*.groovy' task groovyCpdCheck ( type: de . aaschmid . gradle . plugins . cpd . Cpd ) { language = 'groovy' source = sourceSets . main . allGroovy } Here groovy sources excluded from default cpdCheck task (because cpd plugin by default covers all source sets). Now the default task will search duplicates only in java files (and only within sources configured in quality plugin). New task declared for searching groovy duplicates (groovyCpdCheck). Both tasks will be assigned to check , so by calling gradlew check you'll run both checks. Console report will be shown for both tasks (and HTML reports generated). Note that task language will be also mentioned in console report: :check :cpdCheck 2 java duplicates were found by CPD ... :groovyCpdCheck 2 groovy duplicates were found by CPD ... Tip CPD understands many source languages . But if specified language cannot be found, a fallback mechanism uses net.sourceforge.pmd.cpd.AnyLanguage instead. This fallback language does not run ANTLR and therefore also checks duplicates in comments. This way you can use cpd for searching for duplicates even in pure text files, web templates or other resources. Multi-module projects \u00b6 For multi-module projects, it is recommended to apply cpd plugin in the root project. This way only one cpdCheck task is created (in the root project), which will check sources from all modules (it's the only way to find duplicates between different modules). But quality plugin, should be applied on module level (because all other quality tasks are source set scoped). Expected root project configuration looks like this: plugins { id 'de.aaschmid.cpd' version '3.1' id 'ru.vyarus.quality' version '4.2.0' apply false } cpd { // cpd configuration, if required } // possibly other cpd tasks subprojects { apply plugin: 'java' apply plugin: 'ru.vyarus.quality' quality { // plugin configuration, if required } } This way each module have its own quality plugin, but quality configuration is the same in all modules. Quality plugin will detect cpd plugin in the root project and configure it the same way as in single module case. But as quality plugin will apply in each module, only first configured module will apply cpd modifications of toolVersion and ignoreFailures (assuming this settings are the same for all modules). Each module will exclude cpdCheck task sources, not covered by quality plugin configuration. For example, if only main source set configured, each module will exclude test sources. This way, each module control sources only related to its module and overall cpdCheck sources configuration would be correct. Each module will attach all root project's cpd tasks to its check (sub module's check depend on root project tasks). Imagine if you work in one module you may call check only on module level. With common quality tasks its clear - all configured module's source sets must be validated. But you may introduce duplicates (e.g. copied method from other module) and the only way to detect it is to call root project tasks (so its completely logical to assign root cpd check to module checks). As an example, suppose we have 2 modules mod1 and mod2 with root project configuration as described above: root project's cpd plugin will be configured mod1 will exclude mod1/src/test/java from crpCheck.sources :mod1:check depends on :cpdCheck mod2 will exclude mod2/src/test/java from crpCheck.sources :mod2:check depends on :cpdCheck You will also notice, that in the multi-module setup console output will identify class module: mod1/sample.cpd.(OtherStruct1.java:3) [16 lines / 75 tokens] mod2/sample.cpd.(OtherStruct2.java:3) \u2502 3\u2502 public class OtherStruct1 { 4\u2502 5\u2502 public static void main(String[] args) { 6\u2502 Math.sqrt(12); Tip Quality plugin actually search CPD plugin not in the root-most project but in entire parent chain. So if you have complex gradle project and cpd plugin declared somewhere in the middle of projects hierarchy, everything will still be properly configured. Suppress \u00b6 CPD violations could be suppressed only for some languages (Java, C/C++, Dart, Go, Javascript, Kotlin, Lua, Matlab, Objective-C, PL/SQL, Python and Swift) with comments containing CPD-OFF and CPD-ON: public Object someParameterizedFactoryMethod ( int x ) throws Exception { // some unignored code // tell cpd to start ignoring code - CPD-OFF // mission critical code, manually loop unroll goDoSomethingAwesome ( x + x / 2 ); goDoSomethingAwesome ( x + x / 2 ); goDoSomethingAwesome ( x + x / 2 ); goDoSomethingAwesome ( x + x / 2 ); goDoSomethingAwesome ( x + x / 2 ); goDoSomethingAwesome ( x + x / 2 ); // resume CPD analysis - CPD-ON // further code will *not* be ignored } Java sources could be also suppressed with annotations: //enable suppression @SuppressWarnings ( \"CPD-START\" ) public Object someParameterizedFactoryMethod ( int x ) throws Exception { // any code here will be ignored for the duplication detection } //disable suppression @SuppressWarnings ( \" CPD - END ) public void nextMethod () { }","title":"CPD"},{"location":"tool/cpd/#cpd-copypaste-detector","text":"Java by default, suitable for anything (groovy, jsp, simple text etc.) | Home | Plugin CPD support activates only when de.aaschmid.cpd gradle plugin applied manually: plugins { id 'de.aaschmid.cpd' version '3.1' id 'ru.vyarus.quality' version '4.2.0' } CPD is a part of PMD project and so there is no need for additional version configuration (pmd version used).

Note that task language will be also mentioned in console report: :check :cpdCheck 2 java duplicates were found by CPD ... :groovyCpdCheck 2 groovy duplicates were found by CPD ... Tip CPD understands many source languages . But if specified language cannot be found, a fallback mechanism uses net.sourceforge.pmd.cpd.AnyLanguage instead. This fallback language does not run ANTLR and therefore also checks duplicates in comments. This way you can use cpd for searching for duplicates even in pure text files, web templates or other resources.","title":"Multiple file types support"},{"location":"tool/cpd/#multi-module-projects","text":"For multi-module projects, it is recommended to apply cpd plugin in the root project. This way only one cpdCheck task is created (in the root project), which will check sources from all modules (it's the only way to find duplicates between different modules). But quality plugin, should be applied on module level (because all other quality tasks are source set scoped). Expected root project configuration looks like this: plugins { id 'de.aaschmid.cpd' version '3.1' id 'ru.vyarus.quality' version '4.2.0' apply false } cpd { // cpd configuration, if required } // possibly other cpd tasks subprojects { apply plugin: 'java' apply plugin: 'ru.vyarus.quality' quality { // plugin configuration, if required } } This way each module have its own quality plugin, but quality configuration is the same in all modules. Quality plugin will detect cpd plugin in the root project and configure it the same way as in single module case. But as quality plugin will apply in each module, only first configured module will apply cpd modifications of toolVersion and ignoreFailures (assuming this settings are the same for all modules). Each module will exclude cpdCheck task sources, not covered by quality plugin configuration. For example, if only main source set configured, each module will exclude test sources. This way, each module control sources only related to its module and overall cpdCheck sources configuration would be correct. Each module will attach all root project's cpd tasks to its check (sub module's check depend on root project tasks). Imagine if you work in one module you may call check only on module level. With common quality tasks its clear - all configured module's source sets must be validated. But you may introduce duplicates (e.g. copied method from other module) and the only way to detect it is to call root project tasks (so its completely logical to assign root cpd check to module checks). As an example, suppose we have 2 modules mod1 and mod2 with root project configuration as described above: root project's cpd plugin will be configured mod1 will exclude mod1/src/test/java from crpCheck.sources :mod1:check depends on :cpdCheck mod2 will exclude mod2/src/test/java from crpCheck.sources :mod2:check depends on :cpdCheck You will also notice, that in the multi-module setup console output will identify class module: mod1/sample.cpd.(OtherStruct1.java:3) [16 lines / 75 tokens] mod2/sample.cpd.(OtherStruct2.java:3) \u2502 3\u2502 public class OtherStruct1 { 4\u2502 5\u2502 public static void main(String[] args) { 6\u2502 Math.sqrt(12); Tip Quality plugin actually search CPD plugin not in the root-most project but in entire parent chain.

When you use guava functions or predicates you may receive this: [NP_PARAMETER_MUST_BE_NONNULL_BUT_MARKED_AS_NULLABLE] input must be nonnull but is marked as nullable The reason for this is that guava use @Nullable annotation, which is @Inherited , so even if you not set annotation on your own function or predicate it will still be visible. The simplest workaround is to set @NonNull annotation on your function or predicate: public boolean apply ( @NonNull final Object input ) { Hint NP_METHOD_PARAMETER_TIGHTENS_ANNOTATION check was disabled because it does not allow this workaround to work Problems resolution \u00b6 Asm \u00b6 If you specify older (prior 4.0.1) spotbugs verson, you may face asm problem as plugin forces asm 7.3.1 (for spotbugs 4.0.1): dependencies { spotbugs \"com.github.spotbugs:spotbugs:$extension.spotbugsVersion\" spotbugs \"org.ow2.asm:asm:7.3.1\" } This is required because gradle (5.x) downgrades asm: gradlew dependencyInsight --configuration spotbugs --dependency org.ow2.asm:asm org.ow2.asm:asm:7.2 (selected by rule) ... org.ow2.asm:asm:7.3.1 -> 7.2 Which may cause (not always!) execution errors like: Execution failed for task ':spotbugsMain'. > Failed to run Gradle SpotBugs Worker > org/objectweb/asm/RecordComponentVisitor So if you use older gradle simply set correct asm version: afterEvaluate { dependencies { spotbugs \"org.ow2.asm:asm:$requiredVersion\" } } Slf4j \u00b6 Spotbugs plugin use slf4j for logging and by default applies slf4j-simple into spotbugs worker classpath. Sometimes this cause problems due to used sl4j version mismatch with gradl slf4j. To avoid such situations, quality plugin removes \"sl4j-simple\" dependency from \"spotbugs\" configuration.
